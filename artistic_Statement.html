    <h1>Artistic Statement</h1> <br> 
    
    <p>As a Mexican American, I believe it is important that we appreciate our roots and learn 
      where we come from and where our ancestors came from. Growing up, my family had a number 
      of cultural traditions that my parents brought with them when they migrated from the state 
      of Jalisco, Mexico. The curiosity for my culture started when I began dancing at the age 
      of 16. Dancing Mexican Folklórico has taught me why we have the traditions in my family 
      and where they originated from. However, Mexican Folklórico is more than that, it’s a 
      history lesson that is brought to life by performers. Dancing gives me the opportunity to 
      transport immigrants to their native land by showing them a bit of their traditions on 
      stage like the reenactment of the festivities during Christmas times. <br> <br> The performances 
      are dedicated to all those people who left their homeland for a better life, to those who 
      can’t always go back due to any financial or legal situation they might have. I 
      distinguish my work by adding a lot of formations in my dance. You can observe this in my 
      version of La Bruja, form Veracruz, where the women must dance with a candle on their head 
      and do varying footwork throughout the song. Although the footwork is simple there is a lot 
      of formations within the dance. Another focus of mine is the aesthetic of the dance and 
      making sure the dancers show the particular style every region has. The region of Nuevo 
      Leon is known for their strong polkas and that is the style I use in my version A Polka is 
      a lively partner dance where the male and female move as one. Mexican Folklórico has created 
      a great passion for me. I love the rich culture that Mexico has created over time and I 
      enjoy sharing the love that I have for it with the audience that sees my work.
