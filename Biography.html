    <h1>BIO</h1>      
    <p>Oscar Joel Ramirez Benavidez, a Salinas California native, started dancing Mexican folklórico at the age of 
      16 after being recruited to join Tonatiuh- Danzantes del Quinto Sol. He attended Hartnell College and received 
      his associate degree in Liberal Arts with an emphasis in performing arts. After graduating from Hartnell 
      College Oscar became the artistic director for the folklórico group at Hartnell. He later became the artistic 
      director of the group at California State University, Monterey Bay. Not only did he teach at the colleges but 
      also worked as a guest teacher for the Monterey Arts Council and taught students K-12. After moving to San Jose 
      to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in Dance at San Jose State University, Oscar joined Grupo Folklórico Luna y Sol 
      de San José State. After a year with the university group he went on to be a part of Los Lupeños de San José.

<br> <br> Oscar involved himself with many teaching programs and folklórico associations to ready himself for his 
      students. Some associations he has participated in are Asociación Nacional de Grupos Folklóricos, Asociación 
      Nacional de Maestros de Danza Popular Mexicana and Danzantes Unidos, among others. Oscar has performed in 
      cities in California, Nevada, and Texas. He has also taken master classes by teachers in Mexico. Oscar’s 
      training in Mexican Folklórico allows him to properly teach his students about technique and safety in dance. 
      His classes not only offer dance but also historical background about the regions his students will be learning.
      Oscar enjoys teaching and has a great passion for Mexican folklórico.
